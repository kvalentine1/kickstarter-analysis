# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide insight into funding and success trends and patterns of past Kickstarter campaigns. This analysis specifically focuses on the outcomes of theater focused campaigns. Our client is interested in starting her own Kickstarter campaign for her play and our analysis provides her with the relevant information she needs for her campaign to be a success.

## Analysis and Challenges
The data set used for this analysis is a compilation of over 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns encompassing, film, food, technology, theater, and other artistic disciplines. The data set provides us with the fiscal goals of the campaigns as well as the total amount pledged and whether the campaigns were successful. For this analysis, the data was filtered down to theater specific campaigns with a focus on plays. Data was put into charts showing outcomes of the theater category, plays subcategory, and success based on launch date and funding goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data very clearly shows that theater-based Kickstarter campaigns are very successful when started in the late spring. Campaigns that began in May prove to be the most successful with 111 campaigns being successful out of 166 total theater campaigns in May. The successfulness of the theater campaigns drops in the latter half of the year. While theater Kickstarters always have more successful campaigns than failed campaigns throughout the year, at the end of the year in December, the difference between successful and failed campaigns is 2 campaigns. Our client has the best chance of a successful Kickstarter campaign if she launches in May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Theater-Plays based Kickstarter campaigns overwhelmingly have goals under $15,000.00. The most common goal range is $1,000.00 to $4,999.00 which encompasses 534 out of the 1043 plays campaigns. This goal range proves to be very successful with 73% of the campaigns in this range meeting their goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The difficulties I encountered with the data set was not anything to do with the analysis itself. I felt that the data was very easy to work with. Due to how large the data set is and the multiple sheets of analysis, I did at one point have trouble with uploading the excel file to Git Hub. The file size was almost 50mb and was 27mb when compressed. Something was making my file very much enlarged. I copied and pasted my work into a new excel file and it was a manageable size. 

## Results
From the outcomes based on launch date, we can draw two conclusions. One is that May is the month with the most campaigns for theater projects as well as the largest ration of successful campaigns to failed campaigns. This data also indicates that the end of the year is not a good time to start a campaign. November and December have low success rates, especially December which had 37 successful campaigns versus 35 failed campaigns. This data infers that the end of year and holidays may have an impact in how willing people are to support Kickstarter theater campaigns.

From the outcomes based on goals, we see that having a lower goal proves to be more successful. Most successful campaigns have funding goals of $5,000.00 or less. The likelihood of success falls the larger the goal gets with the exception of the $35,000.00-$44,999.00 range which had a success rate of 67%.

Another possible table we can create would be one that compares the funding goals and pledged amounts of campaigns to the months in which they started. With that table, we can analyze how goals and funding fluctuate during the year, and if there are any correlations between goals and time of year for successful campaigns. I also think that it would be valuable to analyze the number of campaign backers and average donation in relation to campaign outcomes as well as funding goals. 

I believe the limitations of this data set is context. We are provided with funding goals, pledges, outcomes, backers, average amount donated, etcetera. However, the data does not give any insight into the social aspect of the Kickstarter campaigns. The data cannot tell us how the creator marketed their campaign and what kind of population they were marketing to. The data does not give us specific locations within the United States which could tell us if area demographics has any influence on campaign success. Additionally, the data does not tell us if a campaign is unsuccessful because the creator never shared it with anyone after creating it. Nor does it tell us if a campaign is wildly successful because the creator had a large online following. The insight the data provides regarding timing and goals of campaigns is very valuable, but for the client to be successful, they will have to do further research into social aspect of campaign success.
